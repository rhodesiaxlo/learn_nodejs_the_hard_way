```
In Node Application, any async function accepts a callback as the last parameter and a callback function accepts an error as the first parameter. Let's revisit the previous example again. Create a text file named input.txt with the following content.
```

```
When an EventEmitter instance faces any error, it emits an 'error' event. When a new listener is added, 'newListener' event is fired and when a listener is removed, 'removeListener' event is fired.
```
